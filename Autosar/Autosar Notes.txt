--AUTOSAR--
-Automotive industry coping up with increasing complexity
-BSW Standardisation
-Hardware Abstraction
-Reusability of function
-Standardisation of exchange formats

Microcontroller abstraction layer-->
it is lowest layer of basic software 

ECU Abstraction Layer-->
it interfaces drivers of the microcontroler
abstraction layer. it also contains drivers for external devices.

Complex drivers layer-->
it spans from hardware to RTE. 

Service Layer-->
it is highest layer of basic software which applies for its relevance for application software: while access to I/O signals is covered by the ECU abstraction layer, the services layer offeres:
OS Functionality
Memory services
ECU state management, mode management
