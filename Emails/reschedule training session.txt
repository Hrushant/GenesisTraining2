Subject: Request for rescheduling the training session

Hello Mr. Sohan,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you that I am facing an emergency that requires 
your immediate attention.

My team is working on Autosar project. We need to complete this project till 30th December 2023. Unfortunately, we don't have enough time to attend the Agile/Scrum training session which is scheduled on 25th December 2023.
I know this session is important for our next project but due to this unevitable situation, we are unable to do so. 
I would be grateful if you could reschedule this session between 1st January to 5th January 2024.

Please feel free to reach out for further clarification. Thank you for taking this into consideration and I look forward for your positive response till tomorrow evening. 

Best regards,
Hrushant Raghwarte
Tech Lead, Autosar
