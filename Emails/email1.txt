sub : Regarding Emergency leave

Hello Program management Team,

I hope you are doing well, I am writing to inform you that I am facing an emergency that requires my 
immediate attention.

There is health issue in my family. For that I will need to take a 2 days emergency leave starting 
from 7th november 2023. I am aware that in this days the presentation skills, emails, and virtual etiquette 
assessments are scheduled. I am commited to completing these assessments but due to this unforeseen 
situation, I am unable to do so. I request you to rescheduling these assessments if possible to a later 
date.

I ensure that I can meet my responsibilities effectively upon my return. I look forward for your positive response.

Best regards,
Hrushant
